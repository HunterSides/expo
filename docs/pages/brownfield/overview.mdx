If you already have a native app for Android and/or iOS and want to learn how to use Expo and React Native in your project, perhaps on a single screen or feature to start, this guide is for you. This type of app is commonly referred to as a "brownfield" app in the React Native ecosystem (as opposed to "greenfield" apps, which are created from scratch using Expo and React Native).

## Compatibility

Expo is primarily built with greenfield apps in mind â€” not all Expo tools and services are compatible with existing native projects.
